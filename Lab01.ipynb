If the circle is empty (⚪), the kernel is idle and ready to execute code. If the circle is filled in (⚫), the kernel is busy running some code.\n",

    "Next to every code cell, you'll see some text that says In [...]. Before you run the cell, you'll see In [ ]. When the cell is running, you'll see In [ * ]. If you see an asterisk ( * ) next to a cell that doesn't go away, it's likely that the code inside the cell is taking too long to run, and it might be a good time to interrupt the kernel (discussed below). When a cell is finished running, you'll see a number inside the brackets, for example: In [1]. The number corresponds to the order in which you run the cells; so, the first cell you run will show a 1 when it's finished running, the second will show a 2, and so on.\n",

    "If that doesn't help, click Kernel, then Restart. If you do this, you will have to run your code cells from the start of your notebook up until where you paused your work.\n",
    "If that doesn't help, restart your server. First, save your work by clicking File at the top left of your screen, then Save and Checkpoint. Next, click Control Panel at the top right. Choose Stop My Server to shut it down, then Start My Server to start it back up. Then, navigate back to the notebook you were working on. You'll still have to run your code cells again."
